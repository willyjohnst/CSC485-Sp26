Goals for this week:

- [x] Create a file to store datasets
- [ ] Find datasets that are relevant to answering our research questions 
- [ ] Go through datasets to assess which ones are the most useful 
- [ ] Save datasets in a file so that they are easily accessible and try to save them in the same format (e.g., all excel sheets, all R codes)
- [ ] Potentially start working on cleaning any datasets that have a lot of missing values, typos, remove and or add whitespace characters, etc.
