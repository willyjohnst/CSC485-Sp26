Goals for this week:

-[ ] Collect historical NHL player performance data

- [ ] Import and clean salary and slate data

- [ ] Merge datasets into a single modeling table

Last Week's Goals:

- [x] Finalize project scope and assumptions

- [x] Identify data sources (stats + salaries)

- [x] Set up project repository and file structure

Week Reflection: This week I made good progress on collecting and exploring historical NHL player performance data by cleaning the dataset and completing several exploratory analyses, including goals versus ice time, shots on goal, and position-based comparisons. These analyses helped clarify scoring patterns and identify which variables are most informative for evaluating player impact. I did not import or clean salary data and decided that salary will likely not be included in the project going forward. Merging additional datasets and moving toward a unified modeling table will be the focus of the next stage now that the performance data is well understood.
