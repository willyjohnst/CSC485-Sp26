To Do List (1/26 - 1/30):
    - Finish making plots that compare accidents among different manufacturers of SAE level 2 Autonomous Vehicles.
    - Explore NHTSA online datasets to find files with accident data that can be filtered for data analysis.
    - More specifically datasets that can be filtered by region (mainly West Coast major cities).
    - Complete further research into how data scientists conduct data analysis and train models on accident data so that any conclusion drawn from the project is not biased or reached on bad methods.
