Goals for this week:

- [CHECK] Create a repo for First Project
- [] Make sure to add the first DataSet I will be working with within the Created repo  
- [CHECK] Sleep
- [CHECK] Plan classes for next week

I was able to make some edit to my proposel and mannage to create a repo in Github.
I thought I had the dataset all set but It seems I have to line by line make sure the "Names" features are consistent.
This took a while and I am still working on it. 

I plan to make sure the coming week I am set with my dataset and can work on some exploratory analysis

Goals for this week:

- [] Push the completed Dataset that I currently have
- [CHECK] Think of some approaches to the Project
- [CHECK] Sleep
- [CHECK] Plan classes for next week

I was not able to complete the dataset as I found more to add onto it. I am looking foward to talking to the professor 
to find other sources that I could use for abilities if I plan to add that to my data analysis. I currently plan to
Scrapp any suggestion that the professor had and hopefully complete my dataset.
