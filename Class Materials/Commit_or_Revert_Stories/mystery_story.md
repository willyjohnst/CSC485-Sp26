# The Unsolved Case

## The Discovery
Late one night, something unusual was found in a place everyone thought they knew well. Accino 101. The classroom we all come to every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
From 1:30 to 2:20, we have seen this classroom as just that. Until... 

## The Witnesses
Several people, Jack and Hame, noticed strange events, but none reported them immediately. They were scared to tell each other out of fear that it was real. 


## Clues
Objects, notes, and minor inconsistencies began to appear. Some were real, some misleading. The notes were all signed by the same hard to read signature. But the most surprising thing was the unexpected witness.


## The Suspects
A few individuals seem connected to the events, though their roles are unclear. Carter was seen leaving Accino on a random Tuesday night, which was suspicious because we didn't have class.

## The Twist
Just when things seemed straightforward, new evidence complicated the case. A bloody hand print was found by the window at the front of the room.

## Investigation
Decisions must be made about which clues to follow and which to ignore. Was Carter meeting someone? Did a note lead her to the classroom? Was this all her plan?

## The Outcome
The mystery is close to being resolved, but there is one more big piece needed. What will happen next? The individuals got away with it and ran free into a different country. Just when things seemed straightforward, new evidence complicated the case.
