Here is a sample weekly update/planner as a markdown (md) file. Markdown is a useful file type to be familiar with because Jupyter nodebooks have their text components in markdown. [Here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) is a website with all of the common formatting rules. [Here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) is a cheat sheet which is more compact.

## 1/12/2026

Goals for this week:

- [ ] Upload  
- [ ] Sleep (from last week)
- [ ] Plan classes for next week

(Notice the specific format for the checklist. A space between the dash and the brackets, a space between brackets if not yet complete, and an x if completed. You can see how this in the raw format becomes a nice checklist when rendered.)

### Last Week's Goals:

- [x] Write a syllabus for CSC 485
- [ ] Sleep
- [x] Plan classes for next week

#### Reflections:

I was able to finish writing a syllabus for CSC 485, the final draft is pushed to the github and posted on Canvas.

In terms of sleep, it was difficult to find much sleep because my son was sick and miserable. This coming week I am hoping to get some more sleep. Last week's difficulties should not interfere since he is not sick anymore. However, I am worried about the large shift in schedule I will have to adapt to since I am teaching at 8:30am on T/W/F. I will update you next week on how that goes.

I was able to plan out the first few days for all of my classes. I will continue to find time to plan classes for next week. I am eager to get into a scheduled routine for which days I plan lessons, which days I grade, and so on.

In the weekly reflection, I address how I met or didn't meet my goals last week. I give ~~excusses~~ reasons why I had trouble with meeting the goals I missed, and a plan on ideas to address it moving forward for next week. In general, the reflections don't need to be longer than a few sentences on each bullet point. Notice that for the task I completed with deliverables, I uploaded the product to github (and Canvas). You should do the same when delivering on code/images/graphs/data sets. Beware that github blocks files larger than 100MiB, so be careful uploading large data sets. You can upload larger files to your OneDrive account to share with me if needed.
