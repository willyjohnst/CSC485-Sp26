### Core Git Concepts

- **Repository (repo)** – A project folder tracked by Git, usually hosted on GitHub.
- **Commit** – A snapshot of changes with a message describing what changed.
- **Commit history** – The timeline of commits in a repository.
- **Branch** – An independent line of development.
- **`main`** – The default branch (sometimes called `master` in older repos).
- **Diff** – A comparison showing changes between versions of files.
- **Merge** – Combining changes from one branch into another.

### GitHub Collaboration

- **Fork** – Your own copy of someone else’s repository on GitHub.
- **Clone** – A local copy of a repository downloaded to your computer.
- **Pull Request (PR)** – A request to merge changes from one branch into another.
- **Maintainer** – Someone with permission to review and merge PRs.
- **Reviewer** – Someone who reads and comments on a PR.
- **Checkout a PR** – Switch your local repository to the PR’s branch.
- **Review** – Reading code and leaving comments or approvals.

### Conflicts & Resolution

- **Merge conflict** – When Git can’t automatically combine changes.
- **Conflict markers** – `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>` shown in files.
- **Resolve conflicts** – Manually deciding what the final code should be.
- **3-way merge** – Comparing:
  - **Base** (common ancestor)
  - **Ours** (your branch)
  - **Theirs** (incoming branch)
